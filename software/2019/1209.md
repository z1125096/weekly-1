**Declarative assembly of web applications from pre-defined concepts**  
https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/12/04/declarative-assembly-of-web-applications-from-pre-defined-concepts/  
https://spderosso.github.io/onward19.pdf
A new approach to web application development is presented, in which an application is constructed by configuring and composing concepts drawn from a catalog developed by experts. The platform (framework) for building these applications is called Déjà Vu, and the unit of abstraction in Déjà Vu is a Concept. Concepts are more closely aligned with application features than with e.g. class-level components. Examples are commenting, scoring, and so on.

**What's New for Node.js in 2020**  
https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/12/04/whats-new-nodejs-2020  
Every year the Node.js community has gained momentum, and 2020 shows no signs of slowing down. There are lots of interesting features being explored for the next major releases of Node.js. In this post I’ll explore some of the most significant updates the Node.js community can expect in 2020.

**JavaScript, ES6, ES7, ES10 where are we?**  
https://medium.com/engineered-publicis-sapient/javascript-es6-es7-es10-where-are-we-8ac044dfd964  
Because I believe everybody should be concerned about when we’re finally getting a replaceAll function in JS, let’s sit and have a bit of a retrospective on what is the current state of the ES-scene. What’s coming, what’s been fully integrated since the infancy of Babel and ES6? After reading this article, you will be an ES-10/10!  另附：[Optional Chaining Has Reached Stage 4 at TC39](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-optional-chaining), [Here’s what people in tech had to say about JavaScript when it debuted in 1995](https://medium.com/dailyjs/heres-what-people-in-tech-had-to-say-about-javascript-when-it-debuted-in-1995-a4b81dc05b71).  

**Blockly Summit 2019: Rendering, Accessibility, and More!**  
https://opensource.googleblog.com/2019/12/blockly-summit-2019-rendering.html  
The library provides everything an app developer needs to create rich block coding languages and is highly customizable and extensible. This means Blockly is also used by hobbyists and commercial companies alike for business logic, computer games, virtual reality, robotics, and just about anything else you can do with code.

**Good code is 90% boilerplate**  
https://www.unitily.com/articles/boilerplate.html  
Im going to stop here rather than going on to maven files, build scripts, etc, which (spoiler alert) just lead to more boilerplate. At the bottom of this article we show the complete UnitilyLang project. It's 2106 characters. The total Java codebase is 22084 characters. So we can build the same project in UnitilyLang with 90% less code.

**低代码开发会是未来吗？**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/M0vrPskxg0SZeQ6cmso7Qw  
长期开发同一类系统的团队都会积累出一套自己的“低代码开发平台”，可能是以代码框架，代码模块，代码模板，拖拽式工具等等不同的形式体现。但这个平台不是给普通用户用的，是给专业开发人员用的，可以极大的提高开发这一类应用的速度。这也是为什么市面上的低代码开发平台产品很多是由外包团队开发出来的。然而这里的限制就是 A 团队长期开发金融类应用，积累了一套针对金融风控类需求的低代码开发平台，B 团队积累的是零售电商领域的，C 团队可能是能源监控领域的，我从来没有见过一个通用领域玩得转的低代码平台。技术的发展日新月异，特别是前端技术，基本上两三年就要换新套路。然而低代码平台很难跟得上这样的节奏，因为积累需要时间。结果就是，你看到的企业应用/政府应用，技术落后，体验差。总结而言，通用的低代码开发平台不可能实现，跟现有业务平台绑定的低代码开发会有一定的价值。

**Web Development in 2020: What You Should Learn**  
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/web-development-2020/  
Brad cuts through a lot of the hype you hear on social media. His advice is practical and realistic. And I agree with him on pretty much everything he recommends you learn.

**Is it time to move on from Virtual DOM(ReactJS)?**  
https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/is-it-time-to-move-on-from-virtual-dom-reactjs-2c01afbf81fb  
Web Component specification enables capabilities to extend existing HTML elements. This gave rise to HTML extension model (Custom HTML elements )was picking up. However, it was nowhere close to being adopted by the browsers natively, but this inspired a new era of component-based JS frameworks, including AngularJS(by Google) and React(by Facebook).

**Introducing React View, an Interactive Playground for Your Components**  
https://baseweb.design/blog/introducing-react-view/

**A Redux Anti Pattern**  
https://rangle.slides.com/yazanalaboudi/deck#/  
Aimed at developers already using Redux, this well presented slide-deck gives a practical example of how to structure actions in a scalable and decoupled way. On Twitter, Pablo Hoc noted that “these slides should be in the official Redux docs. So clear and concise.”

**Electron’s ‘remote’ module considered harmful**  
https://medium.com/@nornagon/electrons-remote-module-considered-harmful-70d69500f31  
Since the very earliest versions of Electron, the remote module has been the go-to tool for communicating between the main and renderer processes. The basic premise is this: from the renderer process, you ask remote for a handle to an object in the main process. Then you can use that handle just as if it were a normal JavaScript object in the renderer process—calling methods, awaiting promises, and registering event handlers. All the IPC calls between the renderer and main process are handled for you behind the scenes. Super convenient! … until it isn’t. Almost every nontrivial Electron app that has used the remote module—Slack included—has ended up regretting their decision. Here’s why.

**Data Transfer Project: Enabling portability of photos and videos between services**  
https://engineering.fb.com/security/data-transfer-project/

All of your communities, conversations, and connections. All of your biometric data and devices. Your entire personal archive in one place that’s secure, private, and designed to last forever. You own and control this OS completely. It’s yours. No one else can look at it without your permission, it can never show you ads. This is what Urbit is. Your Urbit is a simple, durable computer that belongs to you 100% and forever. Urbit is not vaporware. It's real and it works. Two separate companies and a community of contributors are working together to build the Urbit future.

**GNUnet**  
https://gnunet.org/  
GNUnet is a new network protocol stack for building secure, distributed, and privacy-preserving applications. With strong roots in academic research, our goal is to replace the old insecure Internet protocol stack. GNUnet is typically run as an overlay network on top of the existing Internet infrastructure forming the basis of a hybrid peer-to-peer mesh and relay backbone for applications to run on. It could just as well be run independently of the Internet, over dedicated radio and cable. GNUnet is made for a free and open society: It's a self-organizing network and it is free software as in freedom. GNUnet puts you in control of your data. You determine which data to share with whom, and you're not pressured to accept compromises.
