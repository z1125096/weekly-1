**Contract for the Web - A global plan of action to make our online world safe and empowering for everyone**  
https://contractfortheweb.org/  
https://webfoundation.org/2019/12/i-invented-the-world-wide-web-heres-how-we-can-fix-it/  
The Web was designed to bring people together and make knowledge freely available. It has changed the world for good and improved the lives of billions. Yet, many people are still unable to access its benefits and, for others, the Web comes with too many unacceptable costs. Everyone has a role to play in safeguarding the future of the Web. The Contract for the Web was created by representatives from over 80 organizations, representing governments, companies and civil society, and sets out commitments to guide digital policy agendas. To achieve the Contract’s goals, governments, companies, civil society and individuals must commit to sustained policy development, advocacy, and implementation of the Contract text.

**Develop, Debug, Learn? A time to re-think our tooling**  
https://christianheilmann.com/2019/12/12/develop-debug-learn-a-time-to-re-think-our-tooling/  
I don’t have all the answers we seek to make development a simpler task. But I think we are well on the way. With an open mind, open ears and open source we can fix a lot of the things that both tire us and make our market appear less appealing. People are worried about automation and computers taking their jobs. They also are worried about large tech companies ruling the world without opening the doors to people who haven’t got the same education and experience as the ones working in them. By changing our tools to be more all-encompassing and making our accumulated knowledge part of the development process we make a good start to changing that. And we make it easier for the next generation of developers to focus on delivery, not on knowing all about the toolchain.

Dolt and DoltHub let users collaborate on databases in the same way they collaborate on source code. Dolt is a relational database combined with the version control concepts of Git. DoltHub provides a central place to store and share data in Dolt format. Dolt is Git for data. Git versions files.

**Challenging projects every programmer should try**  
http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/challengingprojects.html  
I talk to a lot of students and professional developers that often want to start a side project, but aren't sure what to build. Below is a handful of software projects that taught me a lot. In fact, they're great because you could build them multiple times and learn new things each time. So whenever I don't know what to build or I want to learn a new programming language or framework, I start with one of these:
- Text editor
- 2D game - Space Invaders
- Compiler - Tiny BASIC
- Mini operating system
- Spreadsheet (hard!)
- Video game console emulator (hard!)

**The Product-Minded Software Engineer**  
https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-product-minded-engineer/  
Product-minded engineers are developers with lots of interest in the product itself. They want to understand why decisions are made, how people use the product, and love to be involved in making product decisions. They're someone who would likely make a good product manager if they ever decide to give up the joy of engineering. I've worked with many great product-minded engineers and consider myself to be this kind of developer. At companies building world-class products, product-minded engineers take teams to a new level of impact.

All of your communities, conversations, and connections. All of your biometric data and devices. Your entire personal archive in one place that’s secure, private, and designed to last forever. You own and control this OS completely. It’s yours. No one else can look at it without your permission, it can never show you ads. This is what Urbit is. Your Urbit is a simple, durable computer that belongs to you 100% and forever. Urbit is not vaporware. It's real and it works. Two separate companies and a community of contributors are working together to build the Urbit future.

**GNUnet**  
https://gnunet.org/  
GNUnet is a new network protocol stack for building secure, distributed, and privacy-preserving applications. With strong roots in academic research, our goal is to replace the old insecure Internet protocol stack. GNUnet is typically run as an overlay network on top of the existing Internet infrastructure forming the basis of a hybrid peer-to-peer mesh and relay backbone for applications to run on. It could just as well be run independently of the Internet, over dedicated radio and cable. GNUnet is made for a free and open society: It's a self-organizing network and it is free software as in

https://medium.com/@zackargyle/stop-using-react-for-everything-c8297ac1a644  
当我也成长为老一代开发者，看过了那么多项目花开花谢，我再学习新技术时就不会把它们当成已有事物的终极解决方案了，而只会把它们看作是升级更新，并加入到我自己的知识库里。React 本身也不是全新的东西。它只是将 JavaScript、HTML 和 CSS 打包在一起的另一种途径。Angular 刚出来的时候用的也是这种方法，之前的 jQuery 也一样。业界永远都在追捧下一个热点，但最佳方法就是学习如何正确地编写代码，然后把这件事做好即可——因为不管现在的热点是什么框架、库、支架之类花哨的东西，都是无关紧要的。作为开发人员，你的水平取决于你能以多快的速度，凭借良好的编程基础来适应当前的需求和环境。

**心性：架构师的修炼之道**

怎么成为优秀的架构师？架构师的修炼之道究竟是什么？我的答案是：修心。心性，是架构师区别于一般软件工程师的地方。也是为什么他能够看到那么多人看不到的关键点的原因。架构师成长之旅，是心性修炼之旅。我们需要记得，并不是理解了架构思维的原则，就能够做好架构。架构之道，是虚实结合之道。理论与实践相结合。从实悟虚，从虚就实，运用得当方得升华。架构思维的感悟并不能一步到位，永远有进步的空间，需要我们在不断实践中感悟，升华自己的认知。

**The Power of Community on Reddit**  
https://redditblog.com/2019/09/20/the-power-of-community-on-reddit/  
The social media landscape is changing. In an era of distrust and perfectly-polished online personas, tools that are supposed to bring us together are often making us feel more isolated and distant from one another. At Reddit however, we’ve noticed something different. From page views to time spent on our site and apps, over the past year we’ve seen significant growth in user engagement and conversations—demonstrating that users are deepening their relationships with each other and with Reddit communities. Our users are finding more reasons to visit Reddit, more reasons to become active members of our communities, and more reasons to share the ideas they glean with others.

**Salsify**  
https://snr.stanford.edu/salsify/  
Salsify is a new design for real-time Internet video that jointly controls a video codec and a network transport protocol. Current systems (Skype, Facetime, WebRTC) run these components independently, which produces more glitches and stalls when the network is unpredictable. In testing, Salsify consistently outperformed today’s real-time video systems in both quality and delay.

Every day, whenever I came across an interesting situation, I logged it. All thanks to sitting next to a senior software engineer, I could closely observe what they were doing, and how it was different from what I would do. We pair-programmed a lot, which made doing this easier. Further, in my team culture it’s not frowned upon to “snoop behind” people writing code. Whenever I sensed something interesting going on, I’d roll around and watch what was happening. I always had the context, thanks to regular standups. I sat next to a senior software engineer for a year. Here’s what I learnt.

**Software Architecture Guide**  
https://martinfowler.com/architecture/  
When people in the software industry talk about “architecture”, they refer to a hazily defined notion of the most important aspects of the internal design of a software system. A good architecture is important, otherwise it becomes slower and more expensive to add new capabilities in the future. This page outlines my view of software architecture and points you to more material about architecture on this site.

When I first became a software engineer, I was surprised by the term “religious war” to refer to the angry technical debates that could be had. I wanted to understand what made certain engineering arguments a “religious war” rather than something more consistent with our engineering roots (namely, empiricism and the scientific method). I also became alarmed at the poor engineering choices made after weak technical debates with strong emotions.

Recently I’ve been needing to explain “modern web development workflows” to folks who only have a cursory of vanilla web development workflows and…… It is a LOT to explain! Even a hasty explanation ends up being pretty long.

**frontend design, react, and a bridge over the great divide**  
http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/frontend-design-react-and-a-bridge-over-the-great-divide/  
“Frontend development” is now so loaded that I quipped that as a frontend designer I live on the “front of the frontend”, while there are plenty of other developers living on the “back of the frontend”. I’d like to lean into that distinction because this great divide is played out in a very real way in JavaScript frameworks like React.

The desktop computer hasn’t changed much in the last 30 years. It’s still built on windows, folders and mouse input. But we have changed.

The traditional desktop computer is struggling to adapt the simple interfaces of mobile devices while also keeping its focus on productivity. With people switching to mobile devices for mundane tasks, we have the opportunity to rethink the desktop computer with a focus on getting professional work done.

当我们历数过去十年最激动人心的事件，数据的空前崛起一定要占有一席之地。一夜之间，似乎人人都称呼自己是“数据主义者”，企业纷纷向数字化尤其是其中的数据化快马加鞭地转型。大数据之浪潮风起云涌，AlphaGo的胜利更是在我们每个人的屁股上扎了一针浓浓的鸡血，我们欢呼雀跃，相信数据一定能够带给我们一个非常光明的未来。不过，在走向这个光明的未来之前，我们还得熬过“不那么光明”的现在。不光明，是因为那些自称“数据主义者”的存在，他们所行之事，恰恰与他们所“拥护”的相反。他们的鸡汤越浓，毒性就越大，他们越是激昂高呼，反而越是对数据未来的亵渎。如果他们都算是“数据主义者”，那我们就必须清醒地做一个坚定的“反数据主义者”。无他，只是为了保留一份原初的对数据的敬畏。

**None of my projects want to be SPAs**  
https://whatisjasongoldstein.com/writing/help-none-of-my-projects-want-to-be-spas/  
Back in the early days of SPAs, some people argued that it would be faster to only pass the data you need as JSON than to render whole pages. Nearly a decade later, this is almost never true. I can think of a few things that would benefit from being SPAs. A chat application is a no-brainer. A dashboard of realtime data might not need to be a SPA, but would benefit from a reactive component that updates when the API is polled. Maybe a complicated tool like Trello, a Calendar or a Nonlinear Video Editor could make sense, but even those have distinct screens, so a large reactive component on a particular screen may be a better fit. What’s more interesting is how many apps I’m seeing built as an SPA that really don’t need to be.

As TypeScript stands, I would definitely use it again in small open-source libraries, primarily to make life easier for other TypeScript users. But I will not use the current version of TypeScript in my next large scale application, because the larger the project is, the more the costs of using TypeScript compound.

Two front-end developers are sitting at a bar. They have nothing to talk about.  Let’s say there is a divide happening in front-end development. I feel it, but it's not just in my bones. Based on an awful lot of written developer sentiment, interviews Dave Rupert and I have done on ShopTalk, and in-person discussion, it’s, as they say... a thing. The divide is between people who self-identify as a (or have the job title of) front-end developer, yet have divergent skill sets. 另附：[Designing for the web ought to mean making HTML and CSS](https://m.signalvnoise.com/designing-for-the-web-ought-to-mean-making-html-and-css/).
