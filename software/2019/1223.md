**V8 release v8.0**  
https://v8.dev/blog/v8-release-80  
Will we have a party? Will we ship a new compiler? Will we skip versions 8 and 9 and just stay at an eternal V8 version X? Finally, after over 10 years of work, on our 100th blog post, we’re pleased to announce our newest branch, V8 version 8.0 V8, and we can finally answer that question: It’s bug fixes and performance improvements.

**WebAssembly becomes a W3C Recommendation**  
https://www.w3.org/2019/12/pressrelease-wasm-rec.html.en  
WebAssembly is a safe, portable, low-level format designed for efficient execution and compact representation of code on modern processors including in a web browser. At its core, WebAssembly is a virtual instruction set architecture that enables high-performance applications on the Web, and can be employed in many other environments. There are multiple implementations of WebAssembly, including browsers and stand-alone systems. WebAssembly can be used for applications like video and audio codecs, graphics and 3D, multi-media and games, cryptographic computations or portable language implementations.

**Rethinking Atomic React: an interpretation of Brad Frost’s Atomic Design to use in React projects**  
https://cheesecakelabs.com/blog/rethinking-atomic-design-react-projects/  
Atomic Design is a very widespread topic nowadays within the front-end community, but while looking at several projects, I realized that there is still  a lot of personal opinion on its implementation, and here I list some points that caught my attention throughout the years. This article is not a tutorial on how to create your applications but it is intended to share my interpretation on how to best use this amazing methodology.

**AntV 架构演进-G2 篇**  
https://www.yuque.com/antv/blog/it4eag  
G2 自 2014 年以来已经发展到 4.0，回顾过去，我们发现每一个版本都是一笔记忆，当我们队每个版本的架构进行梳理，分析每个版本背后的思考时，这些记忆就转换成了财富，我从下面这些阶段谈起：G2 之前的图表；v0.1 - v1.0 成型；G2 v2.0 完善图形语法；G2 v3.0 通用场景的支持；G2 v4.0 交互语法和多维分析。

**聊聊AIOps落地监控报警的应对之策**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzUyMzA3MTY1NA==&mid=2247485402&idx=1&sn=6b6e7235eb7f45e6eb10287bccafcc1b  
监控报警是故障发现的重要一环，也是百度在AIOps的最早切入方向之一，目前百度AIOps在监控报警方面已经有两个场景取得突出效果：智能异常检测和智能报警合并。如何支撑AIOps算法在监控报警系统的快速落地并产生业务价值，这对监控报警架构提出了很大的挑战！在上篇《AIOps对监控报警架构的挑战》文章中，我们介绍了监控报警系统在故障处理流程中的位置（故障发现和故障通告），并且分析了AIOps对监控报警架构的三个挑战。在本篇，我们将详细介绍应对这三个挑战的方案：为了应对挑战一，我们研发了策略运行平台，让AIOps算法迭代找到飞一般的感觉。为了应对挑战二，我们提出了基于状态机的事件管理引擎，让事件管理so easy。为了应对挑战三，我们设计了灵活的报警合并方案，让值班工程师彻底跟报警风暴say bye bye。下面我们来详细看下这三个方案的实现细节。

https://ionicframework.com/blog/angular-9-0-0-and-ivy-improvements/  
One of the biggest updates in the pipeline right now is the upcoming release of Angular 9.0.0. Currently in RC, Angular 9.0 will hopefully ship early next year. But this release includes so much that I thought it required a post to highlight some of the most important updates. 

**What Is JavaScript Made Of?**  
https://overreacted.io/what-is-javascript-made-of/  
Over the years, I’ve formed a mental model of JavaScript that gave me confidence. Here, I’m sharing a very compressed version of it. It’s structured like a glossary, with each topic getting a few sentences. As you read through this post, try to mentally keep score about how confident you feel about each topic. I won’t judge you if quite a few of them are a miss! At the end of this post, there is something that might help in that case.

**Evaluating BBRv2 on the Dropbox Edge Network**  
https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2019/12/evaluating-bbrv2-on-the-dropbox-edge-network/  
Overall, BBRv2 is a great improvement over the BBRv1 and indeed seems way closer to being a drop-in replacement for Reno/CUBIC in cases where one needs slightly higher bandwidth. Adding experimental ECN support to that and we can even see a drop-in replacement for Data Center TCP (DCTCP). *Minus the 0.0001% of outliers with a >60% packet loss.

**The On-Device Machine Learning Behind Recorder**  
https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/12/the-on-device-machine-learning-behind.html  
We launched [Recorder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.recorder), a new kind of audio recording app for Pixel phones that leverages recent developments in on-device machine learning (ML) to transcribe conversations, to detect and identify the type of audio recorded (from broad categories like music or speech to particular sounds, such as applause, laughter and whistling), and to index recordings so users can quickly find and extract segments of interest. All of these features run entirely on-device, without the need for an internet connection.

We call this new technique deterministic aperture and it’s available within [Finagle](https://github.com/twitter/finagle), Twitter’s protocol-agnostic remote procedure call (RPC) framework.

**An Update on CDNJS**  
https://blog.cloudflare.com/an-update-on-cdnjs/  
When you loaded this blog, a file was delivered to your browser called jquery-3.2.1.min.js. jQuery is a library which makes it easier to build websites, and was at one point included on as many as 74.1% of all websites. A full eighteen million sites include jQuery and other libraries using one of the most popular tools on Earth: CDNJS. Beginning about a month ago Cloudflare began to take a more active role in the operation of CDNJS. This post is here to tell you more about CDNJS’ history and explain why we are helping to manage CDNJS.

**This Page is Designed to Last - A Manifesto for Preserving Content on the Web**  
https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/  
My proposal is seven unconventional guidelines in how we handle websites designed to be informative, to make them easy to maintain and preserve. The guiding intention is that the maintainer will try to keep the website up for at least 10 years, maybe even 20 or 30 years. These are not controversial views necessarily, but are aspirations that are not mainstream—a manifesto for a long-lasting website.

**Database Internals**  
https://www.databass.dev/  
The book consists of two parts: Storage Engines and Distributed Systems since that’s where most of the differences between the vast majority of databases is coming from. In Storage Engines, we start with taxonomy and terminology, then explore In-Place Update storage and discuss several B-Tree variants and their structure. Then we talk about binary data formats and file organization and explore the ways to compose efficient on-disk structures. In Distributed Systems, we start with basic concepts such as processes and links and start building more complex communication patterns.

http://antirez.com/news/131  
Redis 6 does not bring just ACLs and SSL, it is the largest release of Redis ever as far as I can tell, and the one where the biggest amount of people participated. So, let’s start with credits. Who made Redis 6? This is the list of contributors by commits (it’s a terrible metric, but the one I can easily generate), having at least two commits, and excluding merge commits. Also note that the number of commits in my case may be inflated a lot by the fact that I fix many small stuff here and there constantly.

**张一鸣：人才不是核心竞争力，机制才是！**  
https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/PnjLPyAf2ICtlhO7VWROYg  
“在我看来，创业其实同时在做两个产品，一个是为用户提供服务的产品，另外一个就是公司，而CEO是公司这个产品的产品经理。”这绝非一个好做的产品。伴随飞速增长的不仅是流量、收入与估值，还包括执行团队规模：如今已近5万人的队伍。大量公司会在团队快速扩张时，遭遇文化稀释和管理困局。怎么让一个组织，而不仅仅是一款产品具有持续的竞争力，尤其是在这个组织飞速变大之时？本文试着给大家些许答案。
